            It's difficult to find examples of lorem ipsum in use before
            Letraset made it popular as a dummy text in the 1960s, although
            McClintock says he remembers coming across the lorem ipsum passage
            in a book of old metal type samples. So far he hasn't relocated
            where he once saw the passage, but the popularity of Cicero in the
            15th century supports the theory that the filler text has been used
            for centuries.

          that when the then-understood Latin was scrambled, it became as
          incomprehensible as Greek; the phrase 'it's Greek to me' and
          'greeking' have common semantic roots!” (The editors published his
          letter in a correction headlined “Lorem Oopsum”). As an alternative
          theory, (and because Latin scholars do this sort of thing) someone
          tracked down a 1914 Latin edition of De Finibus which challenges
          McClintock's 15th century claims and suggests that the dawn of lorem
          ipsum was as recent as the 20th century. The 1914 Loeb Classical
          Library Edition ran out of room on page 34 for the Latin phrase
          “dolorem ipsum” (sorrow in itself). Thus, the truncated phrase leaves
          one page dangling with “do-”, while another begins with the now
          ubiquitous “lorem ipsum”.
